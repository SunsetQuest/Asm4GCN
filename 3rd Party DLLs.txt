For security, it's often best to get(or generate) a dll directly from the author’s 
site. I have included links to the source of all DLLs used in this project. 

AutocompleteMenu.dll - this project was used for autocomplete.  The source code can be found here:
 -http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/365974/Autocomplete-Menu

FastColoredTextBox.dll - this project was used for the syntax highlighting textbox.  The source code can be found here:
